Experiment Description	The unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling pathway triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, is induced by a range of environmental factors. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a synthetic small molecule, erstressin, which activates the UPR.  Erstressin induced rapid phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2a and the alternative splicing of XBP-1, hallmark initiating events of the UPR.  Further, erstressin activated the transcription of multiple genes involved in the UPR.   Coincident with these effects, erstressin also downregulated the transcription of the inflammation-associated enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cytokine-activated cells.  A close analog of erstressin that failed to induce the UPR did not attenuate expression of iNOS, suggesting that both biological effects of erstressin were mediated by a common mechanism.  Further, the structurally-distinct ER stressor thapsigargin also inhibited iNOS expression.  Together these chemical genetic studies reveal an unanticipated anti-inflammatory role for the UPR. Experiment Overall Design: We utilized microarrays to understand the global effect of a novel compund, erstressin, on cytokine stimulated cells over time.

Protocol Description	A172 human glioblastoma cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 Â&#956;g/ml streptomycin incubated at 37C with 10% CO2.  2e6 cells/ well of a 6-well tissue culture dish were incubated for 18 hours prior to stimulation and treatment with compound.	Compound was added at 10uM with a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO.  Cells were stimulated with a cytokine cocktail containing hIFN-Î³ (4,000 U/ml), hTNF-Î± (40 ng/ml), hIL-1Î² (4ng/ml).	After incubation with compound and stimulation media, cells were lysed in 350ul buffer RLT, homogenized over QiaShredder columns, and total RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen).  RNA quality and concentration was determined using the Bioanalyzer RNA6000 assay (Agilent).  5Â&#956;g of the RNA was analyzed on U133A 2.0 Gene chips (Affymetrix).
