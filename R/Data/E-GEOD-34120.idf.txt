Comment[Submitted Name]	Differential microRNA profile in frontal cortex of suicide completers compared to control
Experiment Description	Background: TrkB-T1 is a BDNF receptor lacking a tyrosine kinase domain that is highly expressed in astrocytes and regulates BDNF-evoked calcium transients. Previous studies indicate that downregulation of TrkB-T1 in frontal cortex may be involved in neurobiological processes underlying suicide.  Methods: In a microarray screening study (N=8), we interrogated all known microRNA in the frontal cortex of suicide completers with low expression of TrkB-T1 and normal controls. These findings were validated and followed up in a larger sample of cases and controls (N=55) Functional analyses included microRNA silencing, microRNA overexpression and luciferase assays to investigate specificity and to validate interactions between differentially expressed microRNA and TrkB-T1   Results: microRNAs Hsa-miR-185* and Hsa-miR-491-3p were upregulated in suicide completers with low expression of TrkB.T1 (Pnominal: 9.10-5 and 1.8.10-4 respectively; FDR-corrected p=0.031). Bioinformatic analyses revealed five putative binding sites for the DiGeorge syndrome linked microRNA Hsa-miR-185*in the 3â€™UTR of TrkB-T1, but none for Hsa-miR-491-3P. The increase of Hsa-miR-185* in frontal cortex of suicide completers was validated then confirmed in a larger, randomly selected group of suicide completers, where an inverse correlation between Hsa-miR-185* and TrkB-T1 expression was observed ( R=-0.404; p=0.002). Silencing and overexpression studies performed in human cell lines confirmed the inverse relationship between hsa-mir-185* and trkB-T1 expression. Luciferase assays demonstrated that Hsa-miR-185* binds to sequences in the 3â€™UTR of TrkB-T1.  Conclusion: These results suggest that an increase of Hsa-miR-185* expression levels regulates, at least in part, the TrkB-T1 decrease observed in the frontal cortex of suicide completers and further implicate the 3MB 22q11 region in psychopathology. The microarray analysis consists in to compare the microRNA profile of four suicide completers with low TrkB-T1 expression level and four controls. Each RNA extract was labeled with Hy3 and hybridyzed with a reference sample labeled with Hy5. The reference sample was a pool of the eight RNA samples

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Log2(Signal Mean Hy5/Signal Mean Hy3)	The miRCURYâ„¢ LNA array microarray slides were scanned using the Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner System (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) and the image analysis was carried out using the ImaGene 7.0 software (BioDiscovery, Inc., USA).	The hybridization was performed according to the miRCURYâ„¢ LNA array manual using a Tecan HS4800 hybridization station (Tecan, Austria). After hybridization the microarray slides were scanned and stored in an ozone free environment (ozone level below 2.0 ppb) in order to prevent potential bleaching of the fluorescent dyes.	RNA was extracted using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.,Mississauga,Canada) following procedures suggested by the manufacturer.	RNA was extracted using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.,Mississauga,Canada) following procedures suggested by the manufacturer	One µg total RNA from sample and reference were labeled with Hy3â„¢ and Hy5â„¢ fluorescent label, respectively, using the miRCURYâ„¢ LNA Array power labeling kit (Exiqon, Denmark) following the procedure described by the manufacturer. The Hy3â„¢-labeled samples and a Hy5â„¢-labeled reference RNA sample were mixed pair-wise and hybridized to the miRCURYâ„¢ LNA array version 10.0 (Exiqon, Denmark), which contains capture probes targeting all miRNAs for human, mouse and rat registered in the miRBASE version 11 at the Sanger Institute.	The quantified signals were normalized using the global Lowess (LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing) regression algorithm.
